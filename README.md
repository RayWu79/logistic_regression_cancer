# Breast Cancer Detection - Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project analyzes breast cancer diagnostic data to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast masses as benign or malignant, supporting early detection and improved patient outcomes.

## Analysis Goals
- Develop accurate diagnostic prediction model
- Identify key cellular characteristics for cancer detection
- Evaluate model reliability for clinical support
- Guide diagnostic decision making

## Dataset Description
The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset contains:
- ID number - Case identifier
- Diagnosis - Cancer classification (M = malignant, B = benign)
- Cell Nucleus Measurements:
  - Radius - Mean distance from center to perimeter
  - Texture - Standard deviation of gray-scale values
  - Perimeter - Cell boundary length
  - Area - Cell size measurement
  - Smoothness - Local radius variation
  - Compactness - PerimeterÂ² / area - 1.0
  - Concavity - Severity of concave regions
  - Concave points - Number of concave regions
  - Symmetry - Cell shape symmetry
  - Fractal dimension - Cell boundary complexity

## Key Findings
